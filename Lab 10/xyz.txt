The C Programming Language, created by Dennis Ritchie, is a powerful general purpose language. 
It is often used for operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems.
One of C's most important features is its use of pointers, which allow for direct memory manipulation. 
This low-level control makes C extremely fast and efficient.
Remember to properly terminate strings with the null character '\0'. 
Empty lines count as lines, but contribute zero words and characters. Enjoy the assignment!
